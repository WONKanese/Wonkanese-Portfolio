      <p class="about-me">
        Hello, I'm Harrison (@Wonkanese), currently a 10th-grade student residing in Calgary, AB.
        My interest in computer science has grown from a mere curiosity to a deep passion.
        I've cultivated my skills in various programming languages, such as C++, Java, Python, C, C# and JavaScript.
        <br>With a clear vision for success, my ultimate goal is to become a programmer.
        <br><br>
        In the ever-evolving tech landscape, I firmly believe that excellence is the path to achievement.
        I aspire to reach the pinnacle, to belong to the 1% of the 1% in this dynamic field.
        Whether it's tackling intricate problems or crafting innovative software, I am dedicated to continuous
        improvement and pushing my boundaries.
        <br><br>
        <b>This website serves as a gateway into my journey, showcasing my projects and the obstacles I conquer.</b>
